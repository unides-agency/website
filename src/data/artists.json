    "description": "A self-taught and multidisciplinary artist, they move fluidly between music, visual arts, upcycling, clothing customization, and performance. Their creations don't follow formulas — they emerge from a genuine impulse for expression, healing, and transformation. Each piece, each sound, each gesture carries the energy of someone who lives art as both therapy and a tool for expanding consciousness. Their brilliance shines through in the way they see possibilities where others see waste: garments are given new life in their hands, transformed with intention and care. Customization and material reuse are not just aesthetic choices, but a philosophy — a practice that blends sustainability, identity, and creative resistance. Whether on stage or in the studio, their presence is powerful, intuitive, and constantly evolving. With innovative ideas and a deep inner listening, they use art as a mirror and a portal — a path inward, outward, and toward the collective. Their journey is one of healing, and their language is art.",

As both DJ and producer, he electrifies northern Brazil's rich musical heritage - particularly the ecstatic bounce of tecno brega and ceremonial pulse of Toré rhythms - with Berlin's industrial techno might. His newly released KiLOVe album is a revelation: tribal tambores morph into distorted bass weapons, while womb-like frequencies embrace the listener in what becomes both club manifesto and spiritual journey. This is tropical futurism at its most potent - where Amazonian heat dissolves into concrete smoke, creating immersive experiences that honor queer resistance and ancestral memory alike.",
